Morgan is implementing a failover (Tommy's server), but in order to do that
we need to talk with the tech department.

<integ3r> I'm suggesting that the failover be winterhold.skyrim.stratosphe.re
<integ3r> The main should be whiterun.skyrim.stratosphe.re
<integ3r> Talk to the tech department
<integ3r> Get them to add a DNS entry (e.g. service.regisjesuit.com)
<integ3r> and add a CNAME entry to eventreg.stratosphe.re
<integ3r> which is another CNAME, pointing to one of the two servers
<integ3r> both running the Rails app and MySQL.
<integ3r> so, service.regisjesuit.com => eventreg.stratosphe.re => /(winterhold|whiterun)/
<integ3r> There's no redirect
