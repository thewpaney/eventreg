## Introduction

Hello!

Our names are Matthew Haney and Drew Lazzeri.  We're alumni of Regis Jesuit High School in Aurora, Colorado.  Our school needed a web framework for signing students up for stuff, so we jumped on it!

Drew Lazzeri: dlazzeri1@gmail.com (asteroidb612)
Matthew Haney: thewpaney@gmail.com (thewpaney)

We were also assisted by another graduate mentor (our senior):
Morgan Jones: integ3rs@gmail.com (integ3r)
