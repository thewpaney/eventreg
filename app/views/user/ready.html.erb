<h1>Step 2: Wait</h1>

<p><%= user.year.capitalize %> registration will (tentatively) open on <strong><%= user.registration[:open].in_time_zone.strftime '%A, %B %-d %Y at %I:%M:%S %p %Z' %></strong> and close on <strong><%= user.registration[:close].in_time_zone.strftime '%A, %B %-d %Y at %I:%M:%S %p %Z' %></strong>.  Until then, to keep things fair, you'll have to wait.  This page will automatically redirect you to the event registration page when the time comes.</p>

<p>When you get to the registration page, you'll be presented with a <strong>drop-down box</strong> containing every service site available for registration this year.  Sites are presented alphabetically by site category, like this:</p>

TODO: Show the *actual* text box

<p>All you have to do is select the correct site from the drop down box, click it, and click Submit.  <strong>Make sure to verify that you're choosing the correct site!</strong>  If you mistakenly click the wrong site and submit, you will <strong>not</strong> be able to undo your action without talking to your service director.  Plus, you fill up a spot that someone else might want, so no good will come of it.</p>

<p><strong>Sites fill up fast</strong>, so be sure to have a few backups!</p>

<p>If you have any problems registering, you misregister, or you later find that you cannot attend the site for which you registered, contact your service director.</p>
