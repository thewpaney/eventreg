completed college in Khartoum, the capital of his country Sudan,
when he heard disturbing reports coming from his home area. His own
government and hired militias were killing the people in his area.
He returned to Darfur and worked as a translator and genocide
investigator for several organizations including the African Union
for three years. In the course of his work he has been to over 300
atrocity sites. Frustrated by the ongoing genocide, reports not
getting to the outside world, and resulting lack of action, he
began secretly documenting the atrocities and gathering evidence of
his government&acirc;&euro;&trade;s involvement in the ethnic
cleansing of the black indigenous people in Darfur. He did this
knowing full well the potential consequences. Those consequences
became a reality when he was caught by government troops, escaped
and had to flee his country. He&acirc;&euro;&trade;s been shot and
beaten but managed to bring his microchip of photos out of Sudan.
He&acirc;&euro;&trade;s lost his home, family and country to
accomplish his mission. Now he is here in the US sharing his photos
and his personal experience to expose the atrocities and bring
awareness to the dire situation in Darfur.</td>

<td dir="ltr" class="s3">Judaism has always been an evolving and
pluralistic religion. But it's not just a religion, it's also a
sense of belonging to a people that are dispersed all over the
world - from Buenos Aires to Sydney to Moscow and Denver. It's also
a richly textured, intellectual and historical tradition of debate,
conversation, dissent, and activism. In short, being Jewish and
doing Jewish is complex, and what it means depends on who you ask.

<td dir="ltr" class="s3">The original Star Trek series premiered on
NBC television in the fall of 1966. Quietly cancelled by the
network in 1969 Star Trek went on to inspire four spin-off
television shows, an ongoing series of movies (the twelfth of which
Star Trek Into Darkness opens in May of 2013) and a massive,
world-wide fan following. At its best Star Trek has been an
allegory for whatever issues were facing modern American culture
from race relations to poverty to politics to religion. This
Diversity Day session will highlight the American cultural
milestones of which Star Trek was a part and on which Star Trek
wisely commented. There is a reason why many television stations in
the south chose not to air a 1968 episode of the original series
and why Amnesty International partnered with the writers of Star
Trek The Next Generation and why the first American Space Shuttle
was named Enterprise. Come find out what those reasons are!</td>

Through Therapeutic Sports and Recreation</td>
<td dir="ltr" class="s3">The importance of sports and recreation in
helping to improve the lives of people with disabilities has long
been recognized. Those born with disabilities find that sports
provide them with a sense of freedom and joy. They learn physical
and social skills that improve many aspects of their lives. For
others with new injuries or diseases, when first faced with the
reality of a disability, many experience depression and a sense
that their life has ended. Sports and recreation builds confidence,
offers a view to possibilities and provides a chance to reunite
family and friends in a shared activity. People with disabilities
who participate in sports realize the depth of their abilities
while improving overall health and well-being. They improve
endurance, coordination, competitive skills, and build self-esteem.
Our workshop will focus on how the National Sports Center for the
Disabled help people with all types of disabilities (physical,
cognitive and behavioral). Hear from and ask questions of a
participant and/or their parent and from an elite competition
athlete with a disability about how sports and recreation have

<td dir="ltr" class="s3">Dancing is an area that crosses
generational lines, ethnic cultures, and geographic locations.
Salsa dancing is becoming very popular in the United States. It is
fast moving and fun! Salsa's roots are based in Cuba. However, as
it is a popular music, it is open to improvisation and thus it is
continuously evolving. Latin American styles originate from Cuba
and surrounding Caribbean islands and then expanding to Venezuela,
Colombia, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and the
rest of the Hispanic countries; also heavily influence "Miami"
style which is a fusion of Cuban style and North American version.
The styles include "Casino", Miami-Style, Cali-style and Venezuelan
Style.North American styles have different characteristics: Los
Angeles and New York. Both have different origins and evolutionary
paths, as the New York Salsa is heavily influenced by Jazz
instruments in its early growth stage.</td>
